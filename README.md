And if you want use plugin of Cordova in Unity,Just compile them in Eclipse and add java class after compile to ".jar" (Open .jar file in WinRar Window and drag compiled class to it)
Then You can call plugin of Cordova in Unity,
And use UnitySendMessage function to send result from Activity back to Unity Actity
